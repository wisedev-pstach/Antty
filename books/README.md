# Books Folder

This folder is where you should place your PDF books for semantic search.

## Usage

1. Add your PDF files to this folder
2. Run the Antty application
3. Select "📚 Select/Load Book" from the main menu
4. Choose your book from the list

## Alternative

If your books are stored elsewhere, you can also:
- Select "Enter custom path..." when choosing a book
- Provide the full path to your PDF file

## Note

When you build a knowledge base for a book, a corresponding `{bookname}_knowledge.json` file will be created in the same directory as the PDF.
